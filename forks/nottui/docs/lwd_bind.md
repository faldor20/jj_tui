# Caution with Lwd.bind/let$*
Avoid Overuse of `let$*`( which is an alias for `Lwd.bind`)

The `let$*` syntax, while powerful, should be used sparingly in Lwd applications, especially with Nottui. It's crucial to understand its implications and potential performance pitfalls.

## Why let$* Should Be Avoided When Possible
Full Recomputation: The most significant issue with `let$*` is that it causes the any dependencies within it to be removed and reinstantiated. This can lead to unnecessary recomputations and a lot of extra work and thus potential performance issues.

Less clear dependencies: Combining all `lwd.var`s in one place using `let$` and `and$` makes it more easy to see what will cause a recomputation.

## Example of Inefficient Use
Consider this example:
```ocaml
let inefficient_ui =
  let$* count = Lwd.get counter in
  let$* name = Lwd.get name_var in
  let$* items = Lwd.get item_list in
  Ui.vbox [
    Nottui_widgets.printf "Count: %d" count;
    Nottui_widgets.printf "Name: %s" name;
    Ui.vbox (List.map (fun item -> Nottui_widgets.printf "%s" item) items)
  ]
```
In this case, the entire UI will be recomputed whenever `counter`, `name_var`, or `item_list` changes, even if only one of them has actually been updated.

## Efficient Alternative
A more efficient approach would be:
```ocaml
let efficient_ui =
  Ui.vbox [
    (let$ count = Lwd.get counter in
     Nottui_widgets.printf "Count: %d" count);
    (let$ name = Lwd.get name_var in
     Nottui_widgets.printf "Name: %s" name);
    (let$ items = Lwd.get item_list in
     Ui.vbox (List.map (fun item -> Nottui_widgets.printf "%s" item) items))
  ]
```

This version ensures that each part of the UI is only recomputed when its specific dependencies change.

## When to Use `let$*`
Despite these cautions, there are legitimate uses for `let$*`:

- Conditional UI Logic: When you need to make decisions about UI structure based on reactive values.
- Complex Transformations: For operations that genuinely require nested reactive computations.
An example of appropriate use:
```ocaml
let conditional_ui =
  let$* count = Lwd.get counter in
  if count > 10 then
    (* Think of this as a standin for a more complex ui that is reactive*)
    let$ message = Lwd.return "Count is high!" in
    Nottui_widgets.printf "%s" message
  else
    (* Think of this as a standin for a more complex ui that is reactive*)
    let$ message = Lwd.return "Count is low." in
    Nottui_widgets.printf "%s" message
```


Best Practices
Prefer `let$`and `and$`: Use these for most transformations and combinations of Lwd values.
Isolate `let$*` Usage: When needed, try to isolate `let$*` to small, specific parts of your UI.
Review and Refactor: Regularly review your use of `let$*` and consider if there are more efficient ways to structure your reactive computations.
By being cautious with `let$*` and understanding its implications, you can create more efficient and maintainable reactive UIs with Lwd and Nottui.
