Please provide any suggestions. I'm new to jujutsu so I'm sure people have workflows I couldn't even dream of.  
## Installing
If you are on linux, just grab the latest release. It's statically linked and should work on any linux machine.
If you are on mac, also grab a prebuild, let me know if you have any issues as I can't test on a mac.


To open a shell with jj_tui on nix:`nix shell github:faldor20/jj_tui`

To install without nix: **This is definitely broken right now. Please just use nix üôè**
1. Install opam with your package manager
2. clone the repo
3. Run: `opam install .`

## Known issues:
- file contents don't show
- crash after moving a file at the end of the file list
- revision summary doesn't show
- slow when selecting very large revisions

**All the issues listed above are because of the way we currently call out to the jujutsu process, the next major change is to make that concurrent and fix all these bugs.**

## Dependencies
The jujutsu CLI.
I haven't tested on windows or Mac.
I believe it won't work outside Unix so Windows users will currently have to use wsl. 

# Dev
Can be built with nix `nix build` or open a nix shell with `nix develop`
For non-nix the project can be buit with dune or opam.
