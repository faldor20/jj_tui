## Installing
`linux`: Grab the latest release. It's statically linked and should work on any linux machine.
`mac`: Grab a prebuild. Let me know if you have any issues as I can't test on a mac.

To open a shell with jj_tui on nix: `nix shell github:faldor20/jj_tui`

## Dependencies
The jujutsu CLI (minimum version 0.30.0)
I haven't tested on windows or Mac.
I believe it won't work outside Unix so Windows users will currently have to use wsl.


# Config file:
You can make a `config.yaml` config file in the following directories to customize key inputs
`linux`: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jj_tui/
`macos`: ~/Library/preferences/jj_tui/
See `./jj_tui/lib/key_map.ml` for a spec for the keymap and `./jj_tui/lib/config.ml` for the config
The keymap config lets you fully customize all the commands and their sub menus as well as remap the arrow keys.

Eg:
``` yaml
key_map:
  remap:
   h: "left"
   j: "down"
   k: "up"
   l: "right"
  graph:
    #Simple mapping from key to command_id
    p: prev
    #Command sub menu
    s:
      title: "Squash"
      sub:
        # sub menu command
        s: "squash_into_parent"
# If the terminal is smaller than this width, the UI will change to a single pane view
single_pane_width_threshold: 110
# Sets the limit to how many commits are ever rendered in jj_tui. Usefull for not slowing down too much when viewing 'all()' revest.
max_commits: 100
```
For a full list of commands ids see [`jj_tui/bin/graph_commands.ml`](jj_tui/bin/graph_commands.ml) and [`jj_tui/bin/file_commands.ml`](jj_tui/bin/file_commands.ml)

# logs:
`linux`: $XDG_STATE_HOME/jj_tui/
`macos`: ~/Library/logs/jj_tui/

Can be built with nix `nix build` or open a nix shell with `nix develop`
For non-nix the project is currently not setup to build with dune or opam. Sorry, I'll get there one day.
